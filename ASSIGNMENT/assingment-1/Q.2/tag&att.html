<!-- tags and attributes :
    tags :
        ~ HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and 
         where it ends. 
        ~ There is usually an opening bracket followed by the elementâ€™s 
         name and, finally, a closing bracket.
        ~In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag 
        enclosing an element.
        ~Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.
        ~As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag.
        ~ The first one is the start tag. 
        ~It contains two opposite angle brackets. 
    tags Ex :
           <title>
           <p>
           <b>
        ~The other one is the end tag.
        ~The similarity to the start tag, it has angle brackets. 
        ~ However, there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket.
           </title>
           </p>
           </b> 
           
    Attributes :
              ~In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element.
              ~It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside 
              the opening tag.
              ~They control the behavior of the element that follows.
              ~Every tag has two sections. 
              ~The first one is usually the name of the attribute, while 
              the other one is its value.
              ~The two are usually separated by an equals sign (=).
              ~ Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that 
              needs modification.
    Attributes Ex :          
            <imp>
            <input>
            <linke>
            <html>
            <button>
    -->
